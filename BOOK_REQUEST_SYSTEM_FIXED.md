# 📚 Book Request System - Complete & Fixed

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL FEATURES WORKING  
**Servers:** Running (Backend: 8090, Frontend: 8080)

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Issue 1: Books Not Showing in "My Books" Section ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Users couldn't see borrowed books in "Manage Your Books" sidebar
- Database had old test data with user IDs instead of emails in `borrowed_by` field
- Frontend was filtering incorrectly

**Solution:**
1. **Cleaned Database** - Removed old test data with user IDs
2. **Updated MyBooks Component** - Now receives books from parent and filters correctly
3. **Added Return Book Integration** - Fully functional return button with proper state management
4. **Case-Insensitive Status Check** - Handles 'BORROWED' vs 'borrowed'

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/MyBooks.tsx` - Complete rewrite with proper integration
- `frontend/src/components/SidebarNav.tsx` - Added Book type and onReturnBook prop
- `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx` - Pass onReturnBook handler to sidebar

### Issue 2: All Books Showing as "Borrowed" ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Old test data in database had incorrect status values
- Books were marked as borrowed by user IDs (2, 3) instead of emails

**Solution:**
```sql
UPDATE books 
SET status = 'AVAILABLE', borrowed_by = NULL, borrowed_date = NULL 
WHERE borrowed_by IN ('2', '3');
```

All books are now available for request!
