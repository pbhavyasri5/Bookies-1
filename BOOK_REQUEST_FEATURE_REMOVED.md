# Book Request Feature - REMOVED

## Date: October 19, 2025

All Book Request feature changes have been successfully removed from the project.

## Files Removed:

### Backend (Java)

- ✅ `src/main/java/com/bookies/repository/BookRequestRepository.java` - Repository interface
- ✅ `src/main/java/com/bookies/controller/BookRequestController.java` - REST controller with 8 endpoints

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- ✅ `src/components/BookRequestForm.tsx` - User request form
- ✅ `src/components/MyBookRequests.tsx` - User view component
- ✅ `src/components/ManageBookRequests.tsx` - Admin management component

### Documentation & Scripts
- ✅ `BOOK_REQUEST_FEATURE.md`
- ✅ `BOOK_REQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- ✅ `BOOK_REQUEST_QUICK_START.md`
- ✅ `create_book_requests_table.sql`

- ✅ `test-get-pending.ps1`

### Configuration Changes Reverted:

**SecurityConfig.java**
- ✅ Removed all `/api/book-requests/**` endpoint rules
- ✅ Removed admin authorization rules for approve/decline
- ✅ Restored to previous working state

## Current Status:

✅ **Backend:** Compiles successfully (27 source files)  
✅ **SecurityConfig:** Reverted to original state  
✅ **No Book Request endpoints:** All removed  
✅ **Application:** Ready to run with original functionality  

## What Still Works:

- ✅ User authentication (signup/login)
- ✅ JWT token-based security
- ✅ Book management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Admin role-based access control
- ✅ Change password functionality
- ✅ CORS configuration

## To Start Application:

```bash
# Backend
cd c:\JFS-bookies\bookies-backend
mvn spring-boot:run

# Frontend
cd c:\JFS-bookies\frontend
npm run dev
```

The application has been restored to its previous working state before the Book Request feature was added.
