# 🚀 BOOKIES APPLICATION - LAUNCH STATUS

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **BOTH SERVERS RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY!**

---

## 🌐 Server Status

| Service | URL | Status | PID |
|---------|-----|--------|-----|
| **Frontend** | http://localhost:8080 | ✅ Running | 10408 |
| **Backend** | http://localhost:8090 | ✅ Running | 20056 |
| **Database** | localhost:3306/bookies_db | ✅ Connected | - |

---

## ✅ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

### Frontend → Backend Connection: **FIXED!**

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
const API_BASE = '/api';  // ❌ Wrong - relative path
```

**After:**
```typescript
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8090/api';  // ✅ Correct - points to backend
```

**Impact:** Frontend can now communicate with backend properly!

| Service | Port | Status | URL |
|---------|------|--------|-----|
| **Backend** | 8090 | ✅ RUNNING | http://localhost:8090 |
| **Frontend** | 8081 | ✅ RUNNING | http://localhost:8081 |

## 🧪 Testing the New Feature

### As a User:
1. Login with: `user@bookies.com` / `user123`
2. Find an available book
3. Click "Request" to borrow
4. Book status changes to "Request Pending"
5. Wait for admin approval

### As an Admin:
1. Login with: `librarian@library.com` / `1234`
2. Look for books with "Request Pending" status
3. You'll see **Approve** and **Reject** buttons
4. Click **Approve** → Book is assigned to user
5. Click **Reject** → Request is declined

### Testing Backend API Directly:
```powershell
# Run the test script
cd c:\JFS-bookies
.\test-book-requests.ps1
```

## 🎯 Integration Status

### ✅ Backend: COMPLETE
- All endpoints implemented and tested
- Database persistence working
- Security configured
- CORS fixed

### ⏳ Frontend: PARTIALLY INTEGRATED
**What's Working:**
- ✅ UI buttons for approve/reject exist
- ✅ Handler functions present in code
- ✅ Visual feedback with toast notifications

**What Needs Integration:**
- ⏳ Connect handlers to backend API (currently using local state)
- ⏳ Add admin dashboard to view all pending requests
- ⏳ Fetch real data from backend instead of sample data

**Current Behavior:**
- Approve/Reject buttons work but only update **local browser state**
- Changes are **NOT saved to database** yet
- Page refresh loses the changes

**To Complete Integration:**
See `BACKEND_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for step-by-step instructions
