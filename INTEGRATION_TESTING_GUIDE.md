# ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE - READY TO TEST!

## What Just Happened

I've successfully connected your frontend approve/reject buttons to the backend API!

---

## ✅ Changes Summary

### Backend (Already Complete):
- ✅ `POST /api/book-requests/{id}/approve` endpoint
- ✅ `POST /api/book-requests/{id}/reject` endpoint
- ✅ Database persistence with `book_requests` table
- ✅ Security (admin-only access)

### Frontend (Just Updated):
- ✅ `bookRequestService` import added
- ✅ `loadPendingRequests()` function created
- ✅ `handleRequestBook()` now calls backend API
- ✅ `handleReturnBook()` now calls backend API
- ✅ **`handleApproveRequest()` now calls backend API** ⭐
- ✅ **`handleApproveReturn()` now calls backend API** ⭐
- ✅ Auto-refresh after approval/rejection
- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications

---

## 🧪 TESTING STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Servers Are Running

```powershell
# Check backend (port 8090)
curl http://localhost:8090/api/books -UseBasicParsing

# Check frontend (port 8081)
curl http://localhost:8081 -UseBasicParsing
```

Both should return 200 OK.

### Step 2: Test as User

1. Open browser: http://localhost:8081
2. Login with:
   - Email: `user@bookies.com`
   - Password: `user123`
3. Find an **available** book
4. Click **"Request"** button
5. ✅ Should see: "Request Submitted - Your request is pending admin approval"
6. ✅ Book status changes to **"Request Pending"**
7. ✅ Button is now disabled

### Step 3: Check Backend Console

You should see:
```
Creating book request: {bookId=1, userEmail=user@bookies.com, requestType=BORROW}
Book request created: ID=1, Type=BORROW, User=user@bookies.com
```

### Step 4: Check Database (Optional)

```sql
SELECT * FROM book_requests WHERE status = 'PENDING';
```

Should show the new request.

### Step 5: Test as Admin

1. Logout from user account
2. Login with:
   - Email: `librarian@library.com`
   - Password: `1234`
3. Find the book with **"Request Pending"** status
4. You should see **TWO BUTTONS:**
   - ✅ Green "Approve" button with checkmark icon
   - ✅ Red "Reject" button with X icon

### Step 6: Test Approval

1. Click **"Approve"** button
2. ✅ Should see: "Request Approved - The request has been approved"
3. ✅ Book status changes to **"borrowed"**
4. ✅ Shows **"Borrowed by: user@bookies.com"**
5. ✅ Buttons disappear

### Step 7: Check Backend Console

You should see:
```
Approving book request: 1
Book request approved: ID=1, Type=BORROW, Book=...
```

### Step 8: Verify Database Persistence

```sql
-- Check request was approved
SELECT * FROM book_requests WHERE id = 1;
-- Status should be 'APPROVED'
-- processed_at should have timestamp
-- processed_by should have admin user ID

-- Check book was updated
SELECT * FROM book WHERE id = 1;
-- status should be 'borrowed'
-- borrowed_by should be 'user@bookies.com'
```

### Step 9: Test Rejection

1. As user, request another book
2. As admin, click **"Reject"** button instead
3. ✅ Should see: "Request Rejected"
4. ✅ Book status changes to **"available"**
5. ✅ Request saved as REJECTED in database

### Step 10: Test Page Refresh (Persistence Check!)

1. After approving/rejecting
2. **Refresh the browser** (F5)
3. ✅ Changes should still be there!
4. ✅ Approved books still show as "borrowed"
5. ✅ This proves database persistence is working!

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### User Experience:
1. Click "Request" → Creates request in database
2. Book shows "Request Pending"
3. Button disabled while pending
4. When admin approves → Book becomes "borrowed" (persisted!)
5. Can request return when done

### Admin Experience:
1. Login → Automatically loads pending requests
2. See Approve/Reject buttons on pending books
3. Click Approve → Calls backend API → Updates database
4. Click Reject → Calls backend API → Updates database
5. UI refreshes with latest data from database

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Request ID not found" error

**Cause:** Admin didn't load pending requests

**Solution:** Logout and login again as admin (triggers `loadPendingRequests()`)

### Problem: 403 Forbidden error

**Cause:** Not logged in as admin or session expired

**Solution:** 
1. Check you're logged in with `librarian@library.com`
2. Check backend console for authentication errors
3. Try logout and login again

### Problem: Buttons don't appear

**Check:**
1. ✅ Logged in as admin? (`librarian@library.com`)
2. ✅ Book has pending request?
3. ✅ Browser console for errors?

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Open browser console and check:
console.log(user); // Should show { email: "librarian@library.com", isAdmin: true }
console.log(book.status); // Should be "pending_request" or "pending_return"
```

### Problem: Changes disappear after refresh

**Cause:** Backend API not being called (using local state only)

**Solution:** Check browser Network tab
- Should see `POST /api/book-requests/{id}/approve` when clicking Approve
- If not, check frontend console for errors
