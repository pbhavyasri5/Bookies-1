## 🎯 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### What Users See Now:

- Clean, uncluttered book cover display

### Functionality Retained:

✅ **All other features still work:**
- Request Book
- Return Book
- Edit Book (metadata only)
- Delete Book
- Admin Dashboard
- Approve/Decline Requests
- My Books section
- Category filtering
- Search functionality

### UI Changes:

**Book Card Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Book Cover Image  │  ← No overlay button anymore
│                     │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
│ Book Title          │
│ by Author           │
│ [Available]         │
│ [Request Book]      │
└─────────────────────┘
```

## 📞 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Why No Backend Changes?

The `handleImageUpload` function in Index.tsx had a TODO comment:
```typescript
// TODO: Implement actual image upload to backend
```

This means:
1. No backend API endpoints existed for image upload
2. Image upload was client-side only (using `URL.createObjectURL`)
3. Changes were not persisted to database
4. No backend modifications needed

### Future Considerations:

If image upload needs to be re-enabled in the future:
1. Implement backend endpoint: `POST /api/books/{id}/upload-image`
2. Add file storage (local or cloud: S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
3. Update Book model to store image path
4. Restore frontend components from git history
5. Add image validation and security checks
